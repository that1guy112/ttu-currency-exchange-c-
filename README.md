# Currency Exchange System. (RELEASE 1)

Current features:
System correctly converts EUR to USD and vice versa (although the user cannot see it in their balance)
Menu loop functions correctly

Current known bugs/issues (as of Release 1 and will be fixed in future releases):
JPY currency not implemented
when inputting a character instead of a number, the system doesn't respond correctly.
Hardcoded values for conversion rates, client balance.
Not every class has a separate method, as we didn't see a point in adding a method in some classes (e.g conversion_rate is only important for holding different conversion rates)
